# üè† KosanSPK - Smart Boarding House Recommendation System

A comprehensive web-based decision support system that helps students and renters find the perfect boarding house (kos) using advanced recommendation algorithms.

## üéØ Overview

KosanSPK is a Laravel-powered web application designed to simplify the process of finding suitable boarding houses. The system leverages a powerful combination of multi-criteria decision-making algorithms - **ROC (Rank Order Centroid)** for criteria weighting and **SAW (Simple Additive Weighting)** for scoring - to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences and criteria.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

### Key Directories
- **`app/Models/`**: Eloquent models for all entities (Kosan, facilities, criteria, etc.)
- **`app/Services/`**: Business logic services (ROC, SAW, Recommendation algorithms)
- **`app/Http/Controllers/`**: Request handling and route controllers
- **`database/migrations/`**: Database schema definitions
- **`resources/views/`**: Blade template files with TailwindCSS styling
- **`public/storage/`**: File storage for property images

### Key Models
- **`Kosan`**: Main boarding house entity with comprehensive relationships
- **`WeightSetting`**: Configurable criteria weights for recommendations
- **Facility Models**: `FasilitasKamar`, `FasilitasKamarMandi`, `FasilitasUmum`
- **Criteria Models**: `Keamanan`, `Kebersihan`, `Ventilasi`, `Aturan`, etc.

### Services Architecture
- **`KosanRecommendationService`**: Main recommendation engine
- **`RocService`**: ROC algorithm implementation
- **`SawService`**: SAW algorithm implementation
- **`KosanService`**: General kosan business logic

## üß† Algorithm Implementation

### ROC (Rank Order Centroid) Algorithm
The ROC algorithm implementation provides user preference-based criteria weighting:
- **User-Driven Ranking**: Allows users to rank criteria by personal importance
- **Centroid Calculation**: Uses mathematical formula: wi = (1/m) √ó Œ£(1/j) for j=i to m
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Adapts weights based on individual user preferences
- **Preference Integration**: Combines user rankings with system recommendations

### SAW (Simple Additive Weighting) Algorithm
The SAW algorithm provides comprehensive scoring with normalization:
- **Multi-Criteria Normalization**: Converts all criteria values to comparable scales (0-1 range)
- **Weighted Scoring**: Applies ROC-derived weights to normalized values
- **Cost/Benefit Handling**: Properly handles both cost criteria (lower is better) and benefit criteria (higher is better)
- **Final Ranking**: Sums weighted scores for comprehensive alternative evaluation

### SMART (Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique)
The SMART method enhances facility evaluation:
- **Facility Scoring**: Dedicated scoring system for room, bathroom, and public facilities
- **Order-Based Weighting**: Calculates facility importance based on availability order
- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combines with main criteria for holistic evaluation

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

The system evaluates boarding houses based on 12 comprehensive criteria:

| Criteria | Type | Weight | Description |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Price (Harga)** | Cost | 22% | Monthly rental cost |
| **Distance to Campus** | Cost | 17% | Distance from campus location |
| **Room Size** | Benefit | 10% | Room dimensions and space |
| **Security (Keamanan)** | Benefit | 10% | Security measures and safety |
| **Cleanliness (Kebersihan)** | Benefit | 8% | Hygiene and maintenance standards |
| **Location Access** | Benefit | 7% | Access to supporting locations |
